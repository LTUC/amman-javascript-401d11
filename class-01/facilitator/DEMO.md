# Demos: Node Ecosystem

Note: Demos as they exist in the `/demo` folder are provided in their **completed** state.

## Node Server

> `demo/how-fast-is-node`

- This demo showcases just how fast Node.js can be
- Write it quickly and run the shell script (changing the params) show just how much concurrent load a simple node app can handle
- It's super cool to see how many requests per second javascript can deal with

## Tested, Deployed Server

> `demo/server`

For this demo, build out a very simple express server. 75% of this will be a review of what they already know from 301. What's new here will writing a few tests, and moving the 404/500 handlers to separate files (modules). You'll also write a very simple piece of middleware. The goal with this build is threefold:

1. Review of the concepts they already know
1. Sprinkle in modules, middleware, tests at a surface level.
   - You will teach more on these in the coming days. Today, just **show the new concepts** as a way of seeding them with the terminology
1. Show them how a professional developer works
   - Planning, Organization, Git Process, CI/CD

### Work like a real dev ...

- Draw the WRRC (UML Style) of this application
- Start with an empty repository at Github
  - Create with a README and a .gitignore
- Clone your repo and work in a `dev` branch
- Scaffold out a basic working environment
  - `npm init`
  - .eslintrc.json (from the class configs folder)
  - .gitignore (from the class configs folder)
  - Create your basic app structure
    - `README.md`
    - `server.js`
    - `__tests__/server.test.js.js`
    - `handlers/404.js`
    - `handlers/500.js`
    - `middleware/stamper.js`
- Create one route called '/' that sends a simple string to the browser
- Create one route called '/data' that sends a simple object to the browser
- Move your 404 and 500 error handlers to a separate file/folder
  - Unlike in 301, these can now be external modules, making things clean
- Add a simple middleware called "stamper" and add it to both routes
  - This can add something simple to the request object
    - Don't need a ton of detail here, just show it ... we do a deeper dive in a future class
- Write a test of your route

**Connect your `dev` and `main` branches to separate apps at Heroku, to show that each branch can be deployed separately, and that both of the deployments are contingent on your tests passing with GitHub actions**

## Takeaways

- Plan, plan, plan ... don't write code until you know what you're going to do
  - A server with 2 routes, one saying hello, one giving data, with some middleware and a test
  - Draw it, Scaffold it, Fill in the blanks. Teach them APPROACH
- `module.exports` can return anything
- `require()` gets whatever `module.exports` gave you
- Proper README -- make sure students know how to document a lab properly.
