# Facilitators Guide: API Integration

## Overview

The culmination of the Hooks and Context module, in this class, we'll be integrating an API and Authentication server into the application.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
Students will have scaffolded and styled a complete To Do application, including a mock login and authorization system.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll have the students deploy an authentication server and data API of their own and connecting it to their To Do application

**Where we're headed**:
This concludes the module on using Context and Hooks. The next module will introduce Redux, which is another way to manage global state. Redux is a specialist in managing complex application data.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Today, we'll be combining all aspects of Hooks and Context into some real world use cases. The Login/Auth components built in this lab would be an ideal candidate for the students to publish to NPM and use in any future project.

## Preparation

- Revisit the Authenticated API server built in the earlier modules. We'll be needing this for building out these components.
- Deploy your version of it.
  - Or ... use the [official deployed API server](https://api-js401.herokuapp.com) to login and get tokens to use with these components
    - Admin Access: Username: admin, Password: ADMIN
    - Editor Access: Username: editor, Password: EDITOR
    - Guest Access: Username: user, Password: USER

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](./LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Warm Up

As an option (if time allows), break your class into small groups and complete the [warm-up exercise](../warm-up/README.md) for the day. The warm-ups are designed to take about 30 minutes, working the class through an incremental build of a JS Helper Library and a set of CSS components.

These are a fun way to get your days kicked off, if your schedule and code review time allocation allow for it. Review the [warm-up overview](../../warm-ups/README.md) for guidance.

### Code Review

- Following the first day of Context, students will likely have struggled with wiring
- As with all things React, there are many files at play and many dependencies to manage
- Code review for the previous lab should start with a visual -- draw an architecture diagram, map out the component tree and how they work with the state/methods from context
- Once you have solid foundation reset ... visit some broken code!

### TOPIC 1: Login and Auth Review (Server)

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Revisit our previously built Authenticated API server
  - Ensure that we remember how it works
  - Ensure that we have it deployed and usable
  - Revisit the routes and functionality so that we can leverage it in the app
  - In this class, we'll be writing an amazing React front-end that leverages it
- **What** (15 min)
  - Do a code review of the Authenticated API server built in previous modules
    - *found in the project folder for this modeule*
  - POST `/signup` to create users
    - Expects a JSON object with `username`, `password`, and `role` fields
  - POST `/signin` with Basic Authentication
    - Returns a JWT (Token) that contains the username, id, and an array of permissions
  - GET `/oauth` can handle the OAuth handshake process, if there's one configured
    - This should have a corresponding web page with a link that triggers the process
  - Every in the api server can be protected for access by using 2 pieces of middleware
    - `auth` will check the token and continue along if the user is valid
    - `permissions('delete')` will check the user to see if they have the identified capability
  - Once you've reviewed the code and executed some local test runs with the above assertions...
  - Do a deployment and re-test in the cloud
- **How** (40 min)
  - Pair up the students and have them dig up their API servers and deploy them as a group
  - Run this as a workshop
  - It can work well to have a student plugin to the big screen and drive with the others

### Interactive Demo (60 Minutes)

- Workshop and Code Review of the Auth/Data APIs

## Lab Notes

## What might students struggle with today?

- Getting their old API and Auth servers working again
- Remembering how the API and Auth systems work

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
