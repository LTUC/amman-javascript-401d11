## Grading Standards & Notes

- Features

- Deployment
  - Code Sandbox Only
- Documentation
  - README Standards
  - Good UML is essential

## Hints on Grading and Assistance

- The lab is designed to get them touching state and manipulating it for various uses in a few ways.
- This is less about "getting it to work" and more about "understanding how" it works
- The take away from their time in lab needs to be gaining an understanding on the wiring of a Redux application.
- Have the students draw diagrams of the code example in the README and of all of their starter/solution code.
- For grading purposes, tests are not required today, but a good UML diagram is.
