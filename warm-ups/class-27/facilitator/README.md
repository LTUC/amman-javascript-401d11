# Facilitators Guide: `useState()` Hook

## Overview

State management in function components using the `useState()` hook vs a Class component with a more holistic `this.setState()`

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
Students have worked with state in class components in previous courses. They've worked with functional components in the previous lab, but not with state

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be diving into Hooks, principally focusing on `useState()` to provide the ability for functional components to manage their own state. We'll additionally begin writing some rudimentary tests

**Where we're headed**:
In the next class, we'll be introducing the `useReducer()` hook to manage state when it changes conditionally

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are to understand more deeply the differences between Class and Function components, the component lifecycle and using state in function components. A basic understanding of how to use the Hooks API is an important takeaway, as we'll be using them frequently throughout all subsequent modules.

## Preparation

- Read up on the basic hooks use cases
  - `useState()` for state
- Get ready for questions regarding when you'd choose a Class or a Function component and how the lifecycle of a React component actually works
- Practice with React Testing Library as we'll be writing some basic tests for the first time
- Look at previous course student submissions for insight as to what you might see in code review.
- Practice the hooks demo
  - Be ready to dive into pros/cons/differences between functional vs class components

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](./LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Warm Up

As an option (if time allows), break your class into small groups and complete the [warm-up exercise](../warm-up/README.md) for the day. The warm-ups are designed to take about 30 minutes, working the class through an incremental build of a JS Helper Library and a set of CSS components.

These are a fun way to get your days kicked off, if your schedule and code review time allocation allow for it. Review the [warm-up overview](../../warm-ups/README.md) for guidance.

### Code Review

Following the previous class, the students should have a pretty good sense of moving between function and class components. It might be a good idea to give them a quick conversion exercise to remind them of the concepts.

### TOPIC 1: State and Function Components

- **Why** (5 min)
  - To this point, state has only ever lived in Class components
  - It's hard for React to manage the Virtual DOM
    - Needs to maintain state between renders, so class instances make that possible for React internally
  - But it can be frustrating for developers
    - You have to anticipate a need for state and build either a Class or a Function component
    - Classes are cool, but not terribly efficient, nor are they inherently re-usable like a plain function
- **What** (10 min)
  - Internally, React uses an API to manage all of this, which is now well documented and exposed
  - As developers, we can now "hook into" the subsystems of React and make use of things like state management and lifecycles in any component.
  - There are many "hooks" ... first, we will examine the state hook
  - `useState()` manages state in a function component
  - This API allows a function component to declare any number of "state variables" and a function to change them.
  - Of Note:
    - Whenever a variable declared by the state hook changes, the component will re-render
    - The variables can be of any type (string, array, obj, bool)
    - You can have as many variables as you like in a component
    - Functional state is not shared.
      - The same functional component, rendered multiple times -- each has esoteric state.
- **How** (30 min)
  - It's a small syntax adjustment for us to make, but it opens us up to more tactically sized components
  - Execute a quick demo that showcases the basic syntax during lecture
    1. Require the hooks api
       - `import React, {useState} from 'react'`;
    1. In a function component, declare your state variable and a `setState()` equivalent and initialize (in one line!)
       - `const [myAge, setMyAge] = useState(25);`
    1. Render state directly as you please, within the return of the function
       - `<div>You are {myAge} years old</div>`
    1. Within your component, change the state as needed
       - `setMyAge(myAge+1)`
       - When the state changer function is called, this triggers the component to re-render
- **Demo** (30 min)
  - Execute a more in-depth demo (the counter) that uses state to manage something that survives a render
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**

### TOPIC 2: React Testing

- **Why** (5 min)
  - We want to have confidence that our code works as expected
- **What** (10 min)
  - React Testing Library
  - Acceptance Level Testing (no units)
  - Test your app just as a user would use it, not as a developer looking for each function to be perfect
    - "When type in this field, this other thing should change"
    - "When I click this button, that word should change"
    - "When I submit this form, I expect to see some specific data"
  - This amounts to a wiring test
- **How** (30 min)
  - You'll need to "render" your app's main component
  - Give your markup `data-testid` or use static test or aria roles to query the DOM and find your DOM elements to use as input or assert output
  - Fire events where needed
  - Assert that the output has changed
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**

## Lab Notes

- State conversion from class to function should be relatively straightforward
- Make sure that they understand the value in the smaller "bites" of state that this wants you to use
- Testing will be very strange for them for a while
- Encourage them to write fewer tests that exercise more of their app.
- Using the GitHub action, all tests can be run at GitHub as well, following check-ins
